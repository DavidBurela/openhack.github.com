### Announcement

Thank you all for your recommendations on a new location for OpenHackABQ. I'm excited to say that we will be announcing our new home in the very soon. I think this new site will allow us to continue to grow into the future as one of Albuquerque's best developer/hacker groups.

For this next meeting we'll be doing an informal get together at the Flying Star off of Silver. I'm excited to see you all!

### Info

OpenHackABQ's next meetup will be taking place on **Thursday January 15, 2015** at Flying Star off of Silver starting at 6:00pm.

OpenHackABQ's purpose is to offer a space where people of any skill level and interest can get together to develop and design.

Bring any project you want to work on. Don't have a project? No problem.  You'll find someone to pair with at the meetup.

OpenHackABQ is _very_ novice friendly. Just interested in seeing what people are up to? Come on by and sit in on a project someone is working on.

### Next meetup

Flying Star Cafe  
723 Silver Avenue Southwest
