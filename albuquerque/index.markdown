### Announcement

I'm sad to announce that Convivium Coworking is closing its doors at the end of
November.

Convivium's support, specifically that of Deborah Reese, has been a huge factor
in the success of OpenHackABQ. Losing such a great community driven business
is not only a loss to us, but a loss to Albuquerque.

Without Convivium, OpenHackABQ has no home.

I'm cancelling the December OpenHackABQ event and will be looking for a new
space so that we can pick up again in January.

This is a call to action for all of the OpenHackers out there, too. If you,
someone you work for, someone you know, has a space that can accomodate a
group like OpenHackABQ please let me know. If you have _any_ questions, do
not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you, Convivium, for everything you have done to help make OpenHackABQ a
success!

I'll see you all at the November event!

Sincerely,  
[Geoff Petrie](mailto:g.petrie+openhack@gmail.com)

### Info

OpenHackABQ's next meetup will be taking place on **Thursday October 16, 2014** at
[Convivium Coworking](http://www.conviviumcoworking.com/) starting at 6:00pm.

OpenHackABQ's purpose is to offer a space where people of any skill level
and interest can get together to develop and design.

Bring any project you want to work on. Don't have a project? No problem.
You'll find someone to pair with at the meetup.

OpenHackABQ is _very_ novice friendly. Just interested in seeing what people
are up to? Come on by and sit in on a project someone is working on.

### What people are saying

"OpenHackABQ has officially changed my life."

"I have never gotten as far with this project as I did at OpenHack."

"We got so much work done!"

What's the takeaway from this? It seems clear: Come to OpenHackABQ, get tons of
work done and officially change your life!

**See you there!**
