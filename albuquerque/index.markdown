### Announcement

I'm thrilled to announce that our new location has been selected!

FatPipe ABQ has graciously agreed to sponsor us with space for our future meetings. I feel that this will be a terrific pairing of one of the best working groups in Albuquerque and one of the best spaces in the city!

Please get the word out that our new meeting space will now be FatPipe ABQ every third Thursday of the month.

### Info

OpenHackABQ's next meetup will be taking place on **Thursday February 19, 2015** at FatPipe ABQ starting at 6:00pm.

OpenHackABQ's purpose is to offer a space where people of any skill level and interest can get together to develop and design.

Bring any project you want to work on. Don't have a project? No problem.  You'll find someone to pair with at the meetup.

OpenHackABQ is _very_ novice friendly. Just interested in seeing what people are up to? Come on by and sit in on a project someone is working on.

### Next meetup

The next meetup will be **February 19, 2015** at:

FatPipe ABQ  
200 Broadway Blvd NE
