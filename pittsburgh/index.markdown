### Code & Supply Build Nights

![January 2013 OpenHackPGH](/pittsburgh/images/2013-01/general-talking.jpg)

OpenHack stye events are held as part of [Code & Supply](http://codeandsupply.co). Build Nights are typically held on the last Monday of the month at 6pm, but you should check our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/) for the latest.

- Open to anyone, regardless of technology or skill
- The only goal is to create something together and have fun doing it
- Meetings are timeboxed to create a sense of purpose and a reason to follow up at the bar after ;)
- We believe the technology community in this city is a sleeping giant dying for this
