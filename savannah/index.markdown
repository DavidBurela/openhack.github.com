### Info

For an overview of how OpenHack works, check out [the basics](/#the_basics). Basically, you bring yourself, your laptop, and be ready to work on something. Everyone introduces themselves, what they are interested in working on and what they are hoping to get, and then everyone gets down to working and learning together.

We'll provide food and drinks, usually. If you have something you specifically want to eat or drink, or would like to share something, by all means bring it!

Hosted at [ThincSavannah](http://thincsavannah.com/) at 35 Barnard St, Suite 300, Savannah, GA 31401, right on Ellis Square. There's parking nearby beneath. Once you enter 35 Barnard St, take the elevator to the 3rd floor.

Typically every 1st Tuesday from 6PM to 8PM, but follow [@OpenHackSAV](http://twitter.com/OpenHackSAV) for the latest updates and events.
