A place to hack, meet friends, make new friends.

### Where

Hack nights will be held at Nós Coworking at shopping Total, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

### How it works

You participate for free. We still looking for sponsor to provide food & drink.

To prevent a "DDOS" at the venue we ask people to R.S.V.P through [nos.vc](http://nos.vc/openhackpoa)

The Process:

You arrive, say hi, check the projects board.
* If there is a project that please you, move yourself to the group
* if not, you can put your idea at the board and make a 5 min talk about it

Also we will have a board for role needs in projects.

Any question, you can check with the host team during the event.
