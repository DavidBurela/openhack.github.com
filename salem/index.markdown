### Info

Salem OpenHack is hosted by Fast Forward at the our offices at 276 Essex Street.  Pizza and beer are provided.

Our first meeting is Thursday, June 26th.  Come for the beer and pizza, stay for the creativity.

Schedule:

6:30 - The bar is open  
6:45 - Intros - Who are you, what do you like to code, what would you like to learn to code.  
7:00 - Start hacking  
9:00ish - Warm hugs.  Share what you figured out, where you got stuck, and what you want to do next time.

People are welcome to keep hacking, but we will probably migrate to a bar afterwards.

### Directions

We are at 276 Essex Street.  It is the second floor, right above Bella Hair Studio.  If you are coming by train, just walk down Washington Street to Essex Street, take a right and walk to our office.  If you are coming by car, there is plenty of parking behind the office.  It's free parking after 6:00 PM.
