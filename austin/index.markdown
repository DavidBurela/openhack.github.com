### First Meeting: Wednesday, January 30th, 7PM at Capital Factory

We'll be holding our first OpenHack on Wednesday, January 30th at 7PM downtown at Capital Factory.
The address is 701 Brazos, Austin, TX 78701. [Click here for a Google map](http://goo.gl/maps/mKAtt)

For anyone who hasn't been there, there's parking under the building itself (The Austin Centre) (for a fee).
When you get inside the building, look for elevators to offices in the building. Take that elevator to the 16th floor (top floor).
When you step off, you'll be "at" Capital Factory and should see signage as to where to go from there.

### Mailing List

We've started an OpenHack, Austin mailing list:

### Format

We're going to have a little structure around our first meeting (but not too much) to see how it goes. The idea is to
use some structure to grease the wheels a little bit and get things rolling.

- 7:00PM  Meet at CF
- 7:15PM  Introductions (stand-up style)
- 7:30PM  Hack
- 10:30PM "Bring it to the Tribe"
- 11:00PM Hit up a pub if that's your thing

We'll begin with introductions at 7:15. Just say who you are, what you do and where you do it (if you want to),
what languages/frameworks you work with, and anything else you want to share. This is just to let everybody get to
know each other and see who does what so others can help/pair with them, or ask for help if you know something they don't.

Next is the hack session. This is what OpenHack is all about - slingin' code. That's 3 hours. You can pair up with somebody
or work totally alone - it's totally up to you. We encourage you to pair just for the fun of it, but nobody's going to even
-remotely- have a problem if you don't. I mean hey, we're hackers in ATX, there IS no chiller crowd anywhere :)

You can pair or solo hack on anything you want. Open source, closed source. Work. Play. Python. .NET. Ruby. PHP. Java. Scala.
Erlang. Clojure. Haskell. Objective-C. C#. VB. Even [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) - it doesn't matter!
Any skill level on anything on any project, it's all good as long as you're here to sling code.

Finally, we'll wrap up with a segment that, for lack of a better term, we'll call "bring it to the tribe". The idea is that
as a community of developers, engineers and computer scientists, we're a "tribe" of sorts. So we need to help each other out.
OpenHack - for us anyway - isn't just about the code, but also about *the people who write it*! So we want to leverage the
collective widsom of our "tribe" to help each other. This small wrap-up is designed to give people a chance to present a
problem they may be having (code related) to the group. Things like, "I can't seem to grasp rspec's DSL, can anybody
recommend a good book or resource", or "does anyone have any tips on how to convince my boss to let me re-implement this
crufty old system written in outdated perl scripts as a REST-based SOA since it would be just so much cleaner?". Things like
that are what the tribe session is meant for, and we want to provide an open, official forum for members to ask each
other for help in their present challenge. Maybe some one has experience, a book, or a contact who can help you out. This
gives each of us a chance to leverage the group's "tribal knowledge" to solve a problem.

We'll wrap up between 10:30 and 11PM and invite everyone out for drinks (of course totally optional) afterward.

### How often are you running OpenHack ATX?

We're not sure yet. We're going to start it up at once a month for now and if it catches on and folks want it,
we could potentially move to every other week, venue willing.

### We want feedback

OpenHack is about the hacker/developer community. This group exists to give you a repeated/predictable opportunity to get out and among
your peers, hack on a project, develop connections with people, and have fun while being productive. So if you have ideas
on how we can further that goal, or have ideas on our proposed format, either tweet the organizers,
J. Austin Hughey [@jaustinhughey](https://twitter.com/jaustinhughey) and Damon Clinkscales [@damon](https://twitter.com/damon),
or post a message to the above mailing list.
