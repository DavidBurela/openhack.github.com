### OpenHack Meetup Group

We announce our new meetings at the [OpenHack Austin Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/openhackatx/).
Please check that resource for announcements on when OpenHack Austin will be meeting.

You can also check us out on Twitter:
[@openhackatx](http://twitter.com/openhackatx)

### Other, similar options

If you're looking for other options (maybe certain days don't work for you),
there's [Cafe Bedouins](http://cafebedouins.com/).
They generally meet every Tuesday at a coffee shop or other similar location at 7PM.

### Sponsors

We're interested in a diversity of sponsors. If your company is interested in
sponsoring OpenHack, please let us know via Twitter or in person at a meeting.

Our first several meetings have been sponsored by the fine folks at
[Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com) and [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

[Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com) is a Platform as a Service vendor
currently supporting Java, PHP, Ruby and Node.js applications.
Forget your devops and just hand them the code, and they've got it from there.
However you can still exercise a huge amount of control and customization
should you want it.

Most of the open source community is already familiar with
[GitHub](http://www.github.com); they are the world's leading git source
repository host. Account signups are very simple, tools for bug and feature
tracking exist, and it works great for teams. Push your git repository to GitHub
and manage your project easily.

If you'd like more information about either sponsor, please see
[J. Austin Hughey](http://twitter.com/jaustinhughey).

### We're interested in other sponsors, too.

If your company would like to sponsor OpenHack Austin, please let us know.
We'd like to run different sponsors at different meetings,
preferrably where each sponsor compliments the other in some way and is of
course useful to those who attend OpenHack. So if you're interested in
sponsorship, please let me (J. Austin Hughey) know
(give me a shout on Twitter or something).

### We want feedback

OpenHack is about the hacker/developer community. This group exists to give you a
repeated opportunity to get out and among your peers, hack on a project,
develop connections with people, and have fun while being productive. So if you have ideas
on how we can further that goal, or have ideas on our proposed format, send a
tweet to the organizers, [@jaustinhughey](https://twitter.com/jaustinhughey)
and [@damon](https://twitter.com/damon).
