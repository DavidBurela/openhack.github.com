### Next Meeting: Wednesday, December 4th, 7PM at Capital Factory

We'll hold our next meeting at 7PM at [Capital Factory (701 Brazos)](http://goo.gl/maps/mKAtt)
on Wednesday, December 4th.

The idea is pretty simple: come with a project and/or programming language in mind that you know or are looking to learn, and then you'll team up (or pair up) with others who work in that language. Together you'll decide on a project to work on, and at the end of the night we'll all discuss what we did.

As always, if you just want to show up and work on something solo, that's absolutely fine, too. Feel free to bounce ideas off of others while you're there.

This is a great way to meet new people and learn some valuable skills, so come on out!

### Schedule: First Wednesday of each month

For anyone who's never been to Capital Factory, there's parking under the building itself
(The Austin Centre) (for a fee).
When you get inside the building, look for elevators to offices in the building
(should be on the opposite side of the hotel lobby from where the parking garage elevators are).
Take that elevator to the 16th floor (top floor). When you step off, you'll be "at"
Capital Factory and should see signage as to where to go from there, or just ask for Nicholle.
She runs the events there and can show you where we'll be.

### Mailing List, Twitter

- [Mailing List (Google Groups)](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openhack-atx)
- [@openhackatx](http://twitter.com/openhackatx) on Twitter

Please follow us on Twitter and/or subscribe to the mailing list for announcements and updates.
We'll also generally try to keep this page updated at all times.

### Other, similar options

If you're looking for other options (maybe certain days don't work for you), there's [Cafe Bedouins](http://cafebedouins.com/).
They generally meet every Tuesday at a coffee shop or other similar location at 7PM.
It's not as structured as above, but it's another option for you to get in on as well.

### Sponsors

We're interested in a diversity of sponsors. If your company is interested in sponsoring OpenHack, please let us know
via Twitter or the mailing list, or in person at a meeting.

Our first several meetings have been sponsored by the fine folks at [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com)
and [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

Engine Yard is a Platform as a Service vendor
currently supporting PHP, Ruby and Node.js applications.
Forget your devops and just hand them the code, and they've got it from there.
However you can still exercise a huge amount of control and customization should you want it.

Most of the open source community is already familiar with GitHub; they are the world's leading git source repository host. Account
signups are very simple, tools for bug and feature tracking exist, and it works great for teams.
Push your git repository to GitHub and manage your project easily.

If you'd like more information about either sponsor, please see [J. Austin Hughey](http://twitter.com/jaustinhughey).

#### We're interested in other sponsors, too.

If your company would like to sponsor OpenHack Austin, please let us know.
We'd like to run different sponsors at different meetings,
preferrably where each sponsor compliments the other in some way and is of course useful to those who attend OpenHack.
So if you're interested in sponsorship, please let me (J. Austin Hughey) know (give me a shout on Twitter or something).
Sponsorship just consists of pizza and sodas (no alcohol) for the group, and we make your "swag" available to people who attend.

### We want feedback

OpenHack is about the hacker/developer community. This group exists to give you a
repeated/predictable opportunity to get out and among your peers, hack on a project,
develop connections with people, and have fun while being productive. So if you have ideas
on how we can further that goal, or have ideas on our proposed format, either tweet the organizers,
J. Austin Hughey [@jaustinhughey](https://twitter.com/jaustinhughey) and Damon Clinkscales [@damon](https://twitter.com/damon),
or post a message to the above mailing list.
