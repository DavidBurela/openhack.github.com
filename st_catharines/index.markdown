### Info

OpenHackSTC meets on the fourth Monday of the month at [Cowork Niagara](http://www.coworkniagara.com). Please 
[RSVP on EventBrite](http://openhackstc.eventbrite.com) so that we know how much pizza to order.

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openhackstc) for updates. Discuss OpenHackSTC on the [Software Niagara forum](http://forum.softwareniagara.com).

Here's what you should know:

* Hack on anything you want. It doesn't matter what language, framework or license you want to use.
* Hack alone or in a group. 
* You don't need an idea. Find someone to pair with.
* The organizer will order food so you don't need to worry about dinner before you come. Donations or sponsors appreciated.
* Bring your own (non-alcholic) drinks please.
* We will begin at 6:30PM with a quick round of introductions. Tell us about yourself, what you are working in, if you want some help, or if you are looking to help. 
* We will wrap up at 9:30PM. There are many nearby bars if you want to keep the conversation going.
