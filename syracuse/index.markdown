### About OpenHack Syracuse

OpenHack Syracuse is a monthly meetup with a simple purpose: Code together, on anything.

We offer a space where local developers and designers of any skill level can get together to write code or push pixels. We'll provide you with good food, good people, and creative energy.

Here's how OpenHack works:

* You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal projects, client work... anything!
* You don’t have to have an idea to hack on, you can come join someone else
* We'll kick things off with a quick round of introductions, to say who you are, what you’re working on, and if you’d like help with your idea
* Food and drinks will be provided
* We'll generally wrap up around 9pm. If there’s interest, we'll head to a nearby coffee shop or bar for more discussion

Feel free to join us - bring a friend, a laptop, and a project!
